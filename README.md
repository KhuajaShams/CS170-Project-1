The following is a guideline of what is expected when implementing the code and the different scenarios to expect for different inputs:

First, run the output frame of mainTree.cpp in the open terminal by typing $output mainTree.cpp.

You should see a message that asks for the type of puzzle you would like to answer. There are only two options to select, type '1' for default puzzle or '2' to create your own puzzle. Note: the variable to continue playing is set to 'Y' by default, will discuss this later in the instructions. 

After you type '1' or '2' and press ENTER the next task will be different but if you did not input '1' or '2' you will see a message that says "That is not a valid choice!" and you will have to type a new input agaian and again UNTIL you type '1' or '2', there can be spacing before or after but nothing else.

If you typed '1' you should see the following display:

If you typed '2' you should see the following display:
