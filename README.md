# CS170-Project-1
### Zachary Hill and Khuaja Shams

The following is a guideline of what is expected when implementing the code and the different scenarios to expect for different inputs:

First, run the output frame of mainTree.cpp in the open terminal by typing $output mainTree.cpp.

You should see a message that asks for the type of puzzle you would like to answer. There are only two options to select, type '1' for default puzzle or '2' to create your own puzzle.
